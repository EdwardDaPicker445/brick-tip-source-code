I will supply setup instructions if you are not aware on how to setup the src.

Sign up to serv00.
check your email and you should have instructions.
login to your panelx.serv00.com (x is for whatever number you were assigned.)
create a domain e.g. "brick-clone.USERNAME.serv00.com
replace your public html with brick-tip's
edit some configs
hook up the db
you're done!
